# Module 4  Challenge: Pandas

## Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

## District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

- School name

- School type

- Total students

- Total school budget

- Per student budget

- Average math score

- Average reading score

- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by **% Overall Passing** in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by **% Overall Passing** in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

## Math Scores by Grade

Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Include the following metrics in the table:
- Average math score

- Average reading score

- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Scores by School Size

Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

## Scores by School Type

Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.

This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
